    In Python, you don't have to declare variables before you use them.&nbsp; Just assign a value to a name, and you have a variable.&nbsp; Here's x with a value of 12:
    
        x = 12
        
    Create y with a value of 13:
check: |
    def check(t, c):
        with c.expect("You should have a variable named y."):
            names = t.names()
            c.test(names, "You have no variables.")
            if 'y' not in names:
                if len(names) == 1:
                    c.fail("You have a variable named %s." % names[0])
                else:
                    c.fail("You have variables named %s." % (", ".join(names)))
        y = t.module.y
        with c.expect("y should be 13."):
            c.test(y == 13, "Your y is %r." % y)
solution: |
    y = 13
