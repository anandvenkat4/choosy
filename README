Choosy: A tool for writing Python exercises
===========================================

Choosy is an experiment in writing interactive Python learning exercises.
Instructors write exercises as programming problems, and also write code
to check the results of the students' work.

Students complete exercises, then choosy runs their code, then runs the
instructor's check code to determine the outcome of the student's work.

Trying it
---------

At a command prompt:

    $ python chserver.py exercises/first.html

A browser window will appear.  Enjoy.


Writing exercises
-----------------

An exercise might be:

    Create a variable named "a" with a value of 17.

The check could be::

    # check_first.py

    def check(exercise, output, c):
        with c.expect("""You should have a variable named "a"."""):
            names = [n for n in dir(exercise) if not n.startswith('_')]
            c.test(names, 'You have no variables.')
            if not hasattr(exercise, "a"):
                if len(names) > 1:
                    c.fail('You have these variables: %s.' % (", ".join(sorted(names)),))
                else:
                    c.fail('You have this variable: %s' % names[0])

        with c.expect('''"a" should equal 17.'''):
            c.test(exercise.a == 17, 'Your "a" equals %r' % exercise.a)
